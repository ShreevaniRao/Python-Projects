# Python-Projects
##### Using Anaconda, worked on Jupyter notebook to create multiple notebooks to demonstrate Python libraries that I used to collect, clean and explore the data.
##### Coded multiple Jupyter notebooks to collect data using BeautifulSoup library to Web Scrape, Make API calls with Requests library, Pandas to present it in a readable tabular format.
##### Used Pandas & Numpy libraries to clean the dataset uploaded using a CSV file in a well documented Jupyter Notebooks with output shown in a formatted data.
##### Downloaded Kaggle dataset to perform EDA with multiple documented Jupyter Notebooks to showcase the statistical insights of Black Friday Sales & Hotel Booking Demand data with Pandas & Numpy libraries alongwith accompanying visualizations using Bar charts, Histogram, Box Plots, HeatMaps to demonstrate the data distribution.

##### Link for the EDA - Hotel Booking Demand (Ploty figures wont display in local notebook)
